# Heart of Code

## HoC's website, a little Jekyll app built with GitHub Pages.

This app is mostly static pages. If you want to make a change to some text on http://heartofcode.org, you're in the right place!

## Development setup

0. Fork the repo (click the Fork button above), and clone your fork to your local machine. [Here's a GitHub tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) about how to do so.

Please run the following commands on your console:

    $gem install bundler
    $bundle
    $bundle exec jekyll serve

- css aren't working.
