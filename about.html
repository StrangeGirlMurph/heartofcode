  Far out in the uncharted backwaters of
 the unfashionable  end  of the  west
ern  spiral  arm  of  the Galaxy
lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ni
nety-two  million  miles is  an
utterly insignificant little blue green
planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly pr
imitive that  they  still think digital watches are a
pretty neat idea.
This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which wa
s this: most of  the  people  on  it were unhappy for
pretty much of the time.  Many solutions were suggeste
d for this problem, but most of these were  largely
concerned with the movements of small green pieces of
 paper, which is odd becaus
e on the whole it wasn't
the  small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
And so the problem remained; lots of the people  were
 mean,  and most of them were miserable, even the
ones with digital watches.
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all ma
de a  big mistake  in  coming  down  from the trees
in the first place. And some said that even the trees had
been a bad move,  and  that  no one should ever have
left the oceans.
And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years afte
r  one  man had  been nailed to a tree for saying
how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, one
girl sitting on  her  own  in  a small  cafe  in
Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that ha
d been going wrong all this
time, and she finally knew
how  the world  could  be  made  a  good and happy
place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one
would  have  to  get  nailed  to anything.
Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone  to  te
ll  anyone about  it,  a
terribly stupid catastrophe
occurred, and the idea was lost forever.
This is not her story.
But it is the story of that terrible stupid ca
tastrophe and  some
of its consequences.
It is also the story of a book, a book called The  Hitch  Hi
ker's Guide  to  the  Galaxy  -  not  an Earth book,
never published on Earth, and until the terrible catastrophe
 occurred, never seen or heard of by any Earthman.
Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.
in fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to
 come out of  the  great  publishing  houses  of
Ursa  Minor - of which no Eart
hman had ever heard either.
Not only is it a wholly remarkable book,  it  is  also  a
 highly successful  one  -  more  popular  than  the
Celestial Home Care Omnibus,
better selling than Fifty More  Things  to  do  in  Zero Gravity, and more
controversial than Oolon Colluphid's
trilogy of philosophical blockbusters
Where God Went  Wrong,  Some
More  of God's Greatest Mistakes
and Who is this God Person Anyway?
In many of the more relaxed civilizations on  the
Outer  Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker's
Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactic
a as the  standard  repository  of all  knowledge
and  wisdom, for though it has many omis
sions and contains much that is
apocryphal, or at
 least wildly
inaccurate, it  scores  over the older, more
 pedestrian work in two important respects.
First, it is slightly cheaper; and
secondly  it  has  the  words Don't Pa
nic inscribed in large friendly letters
on its cover.
But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story
of its extraordinary   consequences,   and   the
story   of  how  these consequences
 are inextricably intertwined  with
 this  remarkable book begins very
simply.
It begins with a house.
Chapter 1
The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the v
illage.  It  stood  on  its  own  and  looked  over a
broad spread of West Country farmland. Not a remarkable
 house by any means  -  it  was about  thirty  years
old, squattish, squarish, made of bric
k, and had four windows set in the fr
ont of a size and proportion  which
more or less exactly failed to please the eye.
The only person for whom the house was in  any  way
 special  was Arthur
Dent, and that was only
because it happened to be the one he lived in. He had liv
ed in it for about three years, ever since he  had
moved  out  of  London  because  it made him nervous and i
rritable. He was about thirty
as well,  dark  haired
and  never quite at ease with himsel
f. The thing that used to worry him
most was the fact that people always
used  to  ask  him  what  he  was
looking  so  worried  about.  He  worked
  in local radio which he always used
to tell his friends was a lot more  interesting  than they
  probably  thought. It was,
 too - most of his friends
worked in advertising.
It hadn't properly registered with Arthur that th
e council wanted to knock down his house and build an
bypass instead.
At eight o'clock on Thursday  mornin
g  Arthur  didn't  feel  very good.
  He  woke  up blearily, got up,
wandered blearily round his room, ope
ned a window, saw a bulldozer, found hi
s  slippers,  and stomped off to
the bathroom to wash.
Toothpaste on the brush - so. Scrub.
